# LogicCircuitTestingBoard
Made in 2012

I enjoyed digital my first year digital electronics course a lot so I made a logic circuit simulator in Flash.

Open LogigCircuitTestBoard.html for a demo.
Binary versions were compiled in binaries ( a Windows executale, Android executable )
Set cirucits that can be loaded onto the test board can be found in ModelCircuits

Have fun.
