# LogicCircuitTestingBoard
Made in 2012

I enjoyed my first year digital electronics course a lot so I made a logic circuit simulator in Flash.
It supports the most commonly used logic gates:
 not
 and
 or
 nand
 nor
 xor


Open LogigCircuitTestBoard.html for a demo.
Binary versions were compiled in binaries ( a Windows executale, Android executable )
Set cirucits that can be loaded onto the test board can be found in ModelCircuits

Have fun.
